            )
                p This navigation method aims to enhance the user experience by allowing users to interact with the virtual world as if it were a tangible object in their hands. By bridging the gap between the user's interaction and the virtual camera's movement, World-In-Hand Navigation offers a more intuitive, robust, and user-friendly navigation experience compared to the traditional navigation controls provided by Three.js.

            )
                p This extension adds 2D labels to three.js, allowing users to easily create annotations in their 3D scenes with minimal rendering overhead.

            )
                p ModelDecay introduces a solution for voxelization and animation within the Three.js library. This tool enables developers to take a 3D model and convert it into a voxelized representation, subsequently animating the fall of these voxels. The prinicipal objective was to examine the possibility of vanishing/decaying 3D model as a type of object in Three.js tested specifically on said voxelization effect.

            )
                p The goal of this project is introducing superquadrics as a new geometry type in three.js and take care of possible compability issues.

                {name: "Robert", username: "robkosm"}
            )
                p Bounding volumes offer efficient intersection tests for 3D objects. They help optimize tasks like rendering, physics, and user interaction. Although Three.js includes several types of bounding volumes, it currently lacks support for k-DOPs. This project aims to explore how k-DOPs can be integrated into Three.js and compares their performance with other bounding volumes.
